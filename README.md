# 🥊 Japanese Flash Card Game
Project to practice Backend with Django and Frontend with HTML, CSS and JS. I would like to add voice so that in addition to learning how to proper construct sentences, user can hear the pronunciation of each sentence by a japanese native speaker. がんばって! 

This is the final project of the Python Backend Bootcamp taught by códigofacilito.
