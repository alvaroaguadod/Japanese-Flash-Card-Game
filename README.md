# 🥊 Japanese Flash Card Game
Project to practice Backend with Django and Frontend with HTML, CSS and JS. I would like to add voice so that in addition to learning how to proper construct sentences, user can hear the pronunciation of each sentence by a japanese native speaker. がんばって! 

This is the final project of the Python Backend Bootcamp taught by códigofacilito.

In the game or quiz section shown in the screenshot, the learner is required to choose the correct particle to complete each sentence.
